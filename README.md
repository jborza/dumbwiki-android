# dumbwiki-android
DumbWiki is your not-too-smart personal Wiki - structured notebook in bare, simple, plain form. Not everybody needs the smartest software around, it might get annoying with its helpful Clippy paperclip, so that's why we made this.

You can add new pages, edit existing pages and use simple formatting options. Write shopping lists, TODO lists, or keep your personal intelligence files on everyone you know. It's your wiki, on your phone.

Backup and restore functions from SD card are provided if you need to switch phones. 

Formatting provided by JMD Markdown library.
